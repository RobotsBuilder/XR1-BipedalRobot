XR-1 DIY Robot Build Project Repository
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the XR-1 DIY Robot Build Project, meticulously crafted and developed by Christopher Calleja & Shawn Miller.

As of now, the XR-1 is exclusively accessible to private members due to its ongoing development phase. Once it reaches the 90% completion stage, we plan to release this repository to the public.

Important Notes
Software Coming Soon: We are actively working on software to support the 3D build files available here. Stay tuned for updates as we enhance the XR-1 experience.

Beta Section: Please be aware that the files in this section are in the beta phase. Some parts are print-at-your-own-risk, as they may not be fully tested. This section provides early access to files before their official release.

Official Releases: For confirmed repositories in the official release, it's recommended to download from our website www.robotsbuilder.com. These files have undergone thorough testing and are considered stable for use.
